Tableau Projects
This repository contains my Tableau projects showcasing data analysis and visualization skills. The projects cover various domains, including Financial complaints, Hertz rental car, and Lovely dashboard project.

## __Financial Complaints__

- The Financial Complaints project analyzes and visualizes data from financial complaints. The dashboard gives information on the number of complaints, the types of complaints, and major trends over time. Its goal is to assist in the identification of trends and possible areas for improvement in customer service and product offers.

## __Hertz Car Rental__

- The Hertz Rental vehicle initiative investigates the rental vehicle market and delivers critical performance measures and insights into consumer satisfaction. Users may investigate rental vehicle statistics such as customer ratings, automobile models, rental durations, and income analyses using the interactive dashboard. It seeks to deliver actionable information to improve customer experience and corporate processes.

## __Lovely Dashboard__

- Lovely Dashboard is an aesthetically stunning and user-friendly dashboard project. It has innovative design elements, dynamic graphics, and fluid user interactions. The goal of the dashboard is to show the potential of data visualization in delivering interesting tales and engaging the audience.

Each project folder contains all of the essential files, such as Tableau workbooks (.twb), data sources (.csv or .xlsx), and any other resources utilized in the projects.
